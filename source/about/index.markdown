I grew up in Minnesota where I spent my first 29 years. Then I moved to
California where I currently work as a software engineer at
[Causes](http://www.causes.com).

I have an [<abbr title="introversion, intuition, feeling,
perception">INFP</abbr> personality type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INFP)
which makes me the [healer role
variant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healer_(role_variant\)) according to the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. My strengths are Adaptability, Intellection,
Relator, Ideation, and Strategic according to the Clifton StrenghtsFinder.

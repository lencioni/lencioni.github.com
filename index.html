		<p>Sally has been tasked with making the commenting feature in her company&#8217;s
webapp be threaded up to 5 levels instead of only 2 levels. As she makes
adjustments to the code, she collects an unprecedented number of browser tabs.
Some of them point at her company&#8217;s production site, while others point at her
development environment. In many of them, she enabled &#8220;super-user&#8221; mode, so she
could more freely play with her app while making her changes.</p>

<p>So she goes on coding and messing with the data for most of the afternoon.
She&#8217;s about ready to wrap up and head home for the evening when her boss walks
in and asks, &#8220;Sally, lots of comments have gone missing. Do you know what
happened?&#8221; Sally felt like she had swallowed a sack of doorknobs. In the midst
of her coding spree, she mixed up some of her browser tabs and accidentally
deleted live data. A lot of live data.</p>

			Integrating Bower With <em>Rails, Sprockets, and the Asset Pipeline</em></a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We tend to prefer convention over configuration, so when we first began using
<a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to manage our front-end dependencies, we started with minimal
configuration. While this nicely put the files in the expected places, it was a
hassle actually using the assets in our Rails app.</p>

<p>Our basic initial approach was to symlink the assets that we wanted to
reference from the <code>bower_components</code> directory into <code>vendor/assets</code> where
Sprockets would notice them. While this worked in the short term, it was
tedious to set up new packages, and was likely to break if the required assets
were moved when upgrading dependencies.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this felt like a hack. We decided that there must be a better way.
Thankfully there is.</p>

			Sassy Progressive <em>Enhancement</em></a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A mobile-first approach to design can be good: it helps you focus and
potentially simplify your requirements, which can translate into a better user
experience. Likewise, a mobile-first approach to implementation can be good: it
puts the more expensive tasks on the shoulders of clients that are more likely
to be able to handle the extra load, which can also translate to a better user
experience.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.causes.com">Causes</a>, we have been building things with a mobile-first approach both
in terms of design and implementation with a goal of progressive enhancement.
Since switching to this mode on the technical side, we have noticed that our
code is easier to write and more coherent to read, both of which are big
benefits for the engineering team.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ve put together a little project that helps us write readable media
queries in this way. We call it <a href="https://github.com/causes/sass-enhance">sass-enhance</a>.</p>

			Showing Color Chips <em>from Sass Variables</em></a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we like to make our code more maintainable by building reusable
components. Part of this strategy includes <a href="http://joelencioni.com/blog/2013/03/16/10-easy-ways-to-craft-more-readable-css/#two-or-more-use-a-for">assigning variable names to hex
colors using Sass</a>. This allows us to more easily reuse the same colors
everywhere, which improves consistency and makes it easier to re-color the
entire site when our design needs change.</p>

<p>To increase the visibility of these reusable components, we&#8217;ve been building
out a collection of things that designers and engineers can reference, drop in
to projects, and iterate upon. The code sits next to the rendered version,
allowing people to easily see the implementation required to produce the
result. We call this collection the component gallery. It helps us do more with
less code, be more consistent, and iterate on global changes more easily and
effectively.</p>

<p>When we started fleshing out the color variables we wanted to use throughout
the site, it seemed natural to show these colors in the component gallery as
Pantone color chips. That way, designers could reference the colors that we are
using, we&#8217;d have a single place to see that all of the colors look great next
to each other, and engineers could easily pluck variable names when
implementing designs to match the mocks.</p>

			Working With <em>Asynchronously Loaded JavaScript Objects</em></a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Telling browsers to load large JavaScripts asynchronously can significantly
improve performance. This prevents the browser from blocking the rendering of
the page, allowing it to be viewed more quickly. However, if you are loading
dependent files asynchronously, such as a third-party service&#8217;s API, making the
scripts work together is not automatic.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we use Facebook&#8217;s large (nearly 60 <abbr
title="Kibibytes">KiB</abbr> gzipped) JavaScript API on our pages. Although
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/gettingstarted/#loading">they recommend loading it asynchronously</a>, we were already
putting our JavaScript at the bottom of the page and weren&#8217;t convinced that
async would give us much additional benefit. However, after some non-scientific
performance tests it appeared that switching to asynchronously loading the
Facebook API could reduce the time to <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> by nearly a full
second on our pages.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Always code as if the [person] who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live. Code for readability.
—<cite><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.c++/rYCO5yn4lXw/oITtSkZOtoUJ">John Woods</a></cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Diving into a large, old piece of CSS typically is neither easy nor
pleasurable. I find that <strong>the biggest challenges in working with old CSS often
lie in understanding the purpose and interactions of the styles</strong>.</p>

<p>When styling new elements, we have the entire context of the implementation
immediately available, and it is easy to write styles that make sense to us at
that very moment. However, in a few weeks or to a fresh pair of eyes, what made
a lot of sense at first might end up being a lot more cryptic. Without a clear
understanding of the purpose and interactions of the styles, modifying
stylesheets can be dangerous, tedious, and cumbersome. Therefore, it is
important to communicate enough context so that future developers will be able
to grok the code easily and make informed decisions.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a>, we have adopted the following practices which we believe have
improved the maintainability of our stylesheets, reduced bugs, and increased
developer velocity. When you have finished reading this, I hope that you will
have a few more tools to help move your codebase toward greater
maintainability.</p>
